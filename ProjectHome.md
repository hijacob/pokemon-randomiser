# Overview #

This program can be used to randomise the pokemon you will see throughout the game.  Currently GenII and GenIII games are supported.  (Gold,Silver,Crystal; Ruby,Sapphire,Emerald; FireRed,LeafGreen)

# Installation #

The jar file will start the program when executed.  You will need a recent version of the Java environment (JRE).


# How to Use #

Open a pokemon ROM file using the menu.  Choose what parts of the game you want to randomise, and then click the "Randomise" button.  You will then be asked to save the game in a new file.

## Options ##

### Starters ###

You can either change the pokemon you receive at the start of the game to random pokemon, or choose your own.

### Wild Pokemon ###

You can randomise the pokemon you will encounter in the wild.  This includes pokemon you will find in Long Grass, Caves, Surfing, Fishing, Smashing Rocks and Head-butting Trees.  Legendary battles, and other scripted encounters will not be changed.

### Trainers ###

You can randomise the pokemon that NPC trainers have in their teams.  Some trainers (e.g. Gym Leaders) also have a pre-determined moveset for each of their pokemon.  You can randomise the moves that these trainers will use against you.  I aim to give these trainers reasonable movesets in a future release.

### Pokemon Options ###

You can randomise the moves that each pokemon learns by level up (different moves will be learned at the same levels), and which TMs and HMs they can use (each pokemon has a 50% chance of being compatible with each TM and HM).

### Misc Options ###

You can randomise the move that each TM will teach a pokemon (HMs will not be changed for gameplay reasons).

### Fire Red 649 Support ###

When you load a rom of FireRed, you can tell the randomiser to use 649 mode in Misc Options.  This option assumes you have patched the FireRed rom with all 649 pokemon, and will randomly place in pokemon from all 5 generations.
